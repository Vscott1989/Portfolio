         <p><small> Growing up was a struggle.  I didn't speak much English and Spanish was all I heard at home.  As a child my English and Spanish clashed. Reading and writing was a dreadful and overwhelming activity. Asking my parents for help was out of the question.My parents only spoke Spanish and knew very little English. I felt on my own. My third grade teacher finally noticed how difficult it was for me to pronounce words. She suggested speech class, as well as after school tutoring. I felt like an outcast. Although my progress was slow, after two years, I progressed and I no longer needed extra help. For the first time, I felt proud of myself.</small></p>

           <p><small> elementary school, life took me through a journey; I moved several times. My family finally settled down in Dale City, Virginia. My freshmen, sophomore, and junior years went rather quick. My senior year of high school took a turn for the worst, as I became a young mother.</small></p>

          <p><small> Along with the blessing of having a beautiful daughter came new struggles; I did not have much of a choice, but to leave high school and find a job. I had to provide for my newborn child. Dropping out of high school was the toughest decision I ever made. My thoughts of going to college went up in smoke. I did not want to give up on college, so I searched for GED classes, but they were all during work hours. Therefore I self studied to take the GED exam. However, I failed the exam by 2 points. </small></p>

         <p><small> After receiving my results, the GED exam was changed which required me to repay and retake the entire exam. I was exhausted of the run around. Months later my sister moved to Anderson, Indiana, where she learned about The Excel Center. She sold the school very well. In a week, I made my decision. I was not letting this opportunity slip through my fingers. In less than 2 months I moved to Indiana got my high school depolma, became a college student, and graduated Elevenity Academy.</small></p>
